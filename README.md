## About Rachel Sokol

I am an aspiring software engineer, currently a technical instructor of cybersecurity. I just want to build cool webpages that are secure. 

I have been a scrimba pro student for 14 months, and a bootcamp student for almost 2 months. I have learned more from Scrimba about programming and coding than I have in 10 years of self-study. I am very appreciative and hope to one day pay it forward! 

Feel free to message me on discord at slowbloomdev or email sokolcyber@gmail.com
